# Introduction

## Terminology

- *Such as*: Classifications, thesauri, ontologies, subject authority files...
- *Known as:* Terminologies, Knowledge Organization Systems, Semantic Artefacts, Concept Schemes...
- *Core idea*: Things, not strings
- *Done with*: URIs, labels & links between

## JSKOS In a nutshell

- Encoding SKOS and related artefacts (concepts, mappings, concordances...) in JSON
- Knowledge graph data format with focus on knowledge organization systems
- Established infrastructure for controlled vocabularies at VZG
- Mature specification at <https://gbv.github.io/jskos/>

## Background and motivation

- Project **coli-conc** (2013-): infrastructure for (mappings between) knowledge organization systems
- **Cocoda** web application for mapping:
    - Design based on service-oriented architecture (SOA)
    - No server but everything (terminologies, mappings, accounts...) loosely coupled via APIs
    - ⇒ JSON
- Integration of federated data ⇒ RDF

## Influences and references

- **SKOS** for core classes and properties only
- **JSON-LD** for mapping to RDF
- Skosmos API and similar
- Wikibase Data Model
- [Web Annotation Data Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/) for annotations
- [GeoJSON] for geospatial data
- [IIIF](https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/) for media
- DCAT(-AP), vCard, XKOS, SSSOM...

## Some design guidelines

- Use exising standards (e.g. SKOS)
- Use URIs if possible
- Repeatable fields ⇔  arrays
- Standard first, implementation with tests and validation
- New features only with use case and data from practice

# Features of JSKOS

## Example

~~~json
{
  "uri": "..."
  "prefLabel": {
    "
  }
}
~~~

## Object types

- **Concepts** and **Concept Schemes**
- **Mappings** and **Concordances**
- **Occurrences** of 
- **Registries**, **Distributions** and **Services**
- Superclasses
  - **Item** (named entity) and **Resource** (anything)
  - **Concept bundles**

## Concept bundles

Combination of concepts (e.g. early medieval cooking):

~~~json
{
  "uri": "http://dewey.info/class/641.50902/e23/",
  "notation": [ "641.50902" ],
  "memberList": [ {
    "uri": "http://dewey.info/class/641/e23/",
    "prefLabel": { "en": "Cooking" }
  }, {
    "uri": "http://dewey.info/class/1--0902/e23/",
    "prefLabel": { "en": "6th to 12th century (500-1199)" }
  } ]
}
~~~

## Concepts and Concept Schemes

- Common fields found in


- TODO: example
- Mainly SKOS
- Addition fields commonly found in terminologies:
    - previous/next
    - startDate/endDate
    - location, media, address
    - ...
- Simplification to common denominator (just like SKOS)!

## Features of JSKOS

...such as concept occurrences, annotations, and qualified statements

---------------


## JSKOS API

- GET/POST/PUT/PATCH data in JSKOS format
- terminologies, mappings, concordances... (see later)

Not focus of this talk.

## Applications & implementations

- [Cocoda]
- [BARTOC](https://bartoc.org/)
- [DANTE](https://api.dante.gbv.de/) 
- NFDI4Objects & TS4NFDI
- Konsys
- ...

## Applications & Libraries

- jskos-server: DBMS to store JSKOS data
- jskos-vue: widgets to nicely display JSKOS objects in browser (e.g. tree)
- jskos-proxy: serve and browse JSKOS data (terminologies) as Linked Open Data
- jskos-tools: helper functions for JSKOS data
- jskos-cli: tools to validate and convert JSKOS data
- ...

## TODO: Diagram

- wrapper for terminologies
- wrapper for mappings
- JSKOS API

## Why not JSON-LD?

- JSON-LD 1.0 released July 2012 to January 2014
- JSKOS 0.0.1 released in September 2014, prior work in 2013
- JSON-LD has limitations
- RDF was not our priority except for Linked Data principle 1: *Use URIs as names for things*

## JSON-LD has limitations

Common misunderstanding:

Parse JSON-LD with an RDF => syntax is secondary

RDF is just a secondary

- Use of JSON format without JSON Schema is limited

JSON-LD is

- 👍 writing RDF
- 👍 reading RDF
- 👎 well-defined key-value structure

## JSKOS is also JSON-LD

- JSKOS can be & is processed as JSON-LD with a non-normative \@context document to get RDF
- Some JSKOS fields require additional processing step or agreement on which property URIs to use


## End of opinion about JSON-LD

JSON-LD + JSON Schema => well-defined data usable both as plain JSON and as RDF graph

Example: repeatable fields are always arrays.

## Inspiration from Wikibase data model

## Comparision

## When to use

One-man show

NFDI

VZG

## Wish/idea

Specify a subset of JSKOS as official JSON(-LD) for SKOS
