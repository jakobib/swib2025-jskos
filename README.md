The [JSKOS data format](https://gbv.github.io/jskos/) (JSON for Knowledge Organization Systems) was first created in 2014, mainly to encode SKOS and mappings between semantic artifacts in web applications. Since its initial draft it has been extended and implemented in applications such as [Cocoda mapping tool](https://coli-conc.gbv.de/cocoda/), [BARTOC terminology registry](https://bartoc.org/) and [DANTE terminology registry](https://api.dante.gbv.de/). The format has since been extened with features such as concept occurrences, annotations, and qualified statements, to become a knowledge graph data format in its own right, and it has become a core part of the infrastructure for controlled vocabularies at VZG.

This presentation will outline the motivation behind JSKOS and illustrate its core capabilities and limitations. The role of JSKOS for authority files and data integration at VZG and NFDI will be shown and it will be compared with alternative knowledge graph formats such as RDF, RDF-star, property graphs, and the data model of Wikibase.
